The game requires the use of the keyboard and mouse for Player 1, and Player 2 must use a PC-compatible controller.

The mission is to kill the other enemy player. Use the mousebutton/controller trigger to initiate an assassination. If a character has a glowing ball above its head, you can kill it.
You can move around and jump. Everyone looks alike, so it's up to you to figure out which one is the PLAYER, and not
an AI. the AI mimic your movements, but the further away they are, the longer it'll take for them to mimic you.
So jump, and test your opponent to time his/her jump, else stick out like a sore thumb!

When trying to assassinate the opponent, the hitbox for it is to the right and forward a bit for your player, so aim there. 

Restart the game once one has killed another.
